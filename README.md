# Olympians

Welcome to the Olympians gem! 

The Olympians gem is a simple program designed to scrape the webpage greekgodsandgoddesses.net and return some basic information about the five Olympian Gods listed in the program. To install the gem, please read the directions below and have fun learning!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'olympians'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install olympians

## Usage

To use the Olympians gem after either installing it or cloning it, make sure you're in the correct file by typing 'cd olympians' into your terminal. Next, run the program by typing 'ruby bin/olympian_run' into your terminal. Follow the prompt by typing in the number of the god you wish to learn more about followed by the enter key, or exit to terminate the program. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
